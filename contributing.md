# Contributing to Zzz

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing.

If [zzz.software/about](https://zzz.software/about/) sounds interesting to you,
I'm welcoming help to iterate in public on APIs, high level design direction,
and prioritization (e.g. for integrations).
Submit questions, design ideas, bug reports, use cases, etc,
to the [discussions](https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/discussions),
[issues](https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/issues) (bugs/more technical),
or find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ryanatkn.com).

## Developers

Zzz isn't published to npm but it will be soon.
If you're looking for that, I'd accept a PR that replaces this line with a link to a new issue requesting it. Until there's that part of demand or until I get further along, Zzz will remain unpublished to reduce churn.

I'm open to PRs when they fit the project's design goals, which can be subtle and arbitrary
and ill-communicated (:(), but I generally want to make the software as useful as possible
for as many people as possible without putting undue burden on power users,
and I'm open to communicating about decisions and how I'm making them.
Feel free to open PRs for straightforward changes--most PRs should reference an issue
to keep the discussion legible.

The code is permissively licensed so no CLA,
[zzz.software](https://www.zzz.software/) is noncommercial,
and forking is encouraged.
