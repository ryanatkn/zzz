			Zzz, pronounced "zees" like bees, is a fullstack app and toolkit for power users and
			developers. The idea is to make an integrated cross-platform environment that adapts to your
			needs and intent while remaining fully open, aligned, and in your control. It's both a
			customizable local-first web UI for power users, and a flexible library for crafting
			UX-maximizing websites with a streamlined developer experience.

		<p>Some early (rough) integrations include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<External_Link href="https://hono.dev/">Hono</External_Link> is the backend web server that provides
				local system access. It's uses web standards and supports all JS server runtimes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<External_Link href="https://svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</External_Link> is the frontend framework.
				Hono integrates with its Node adapter, and it uses <External_Link href="https://vite.dev/"
					>Vite</External_Link
				> in development.
			</li>
			<li>
				AI providers with <External_Link href="https://github.com/openai/openai-node"
					>ChatGPT</External_Link
				>,
				<External_Link href="https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-typescript"
					>Claude</External_Link
				>, and <External_Link href="https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-js"
					>Gemini</External_Link
				> -- bring your own API keys
			</li>
			<li>
				<External_Link href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama">Ollama</External_Link> runs AI models
				locally with easy installation and onboarding. I plan to support more local LLM backends like
				<External_Link href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</External_Link> which Ollama
				is based on.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Planned integrations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<!-- TODO @db -->
				<External_Link href="https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite">pglite</External_Link>
				and full <External_Link href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</External_Link> when desired,
				using <External_Link href="https://github.com/porsager/postgres">Postgres.js</External_Link>
				and probably <External_Link href="https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm"
					>Drizzle</External_Link
				>, see <External_Link href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/issues/7"
					>issue #7</External_Link
				>
			</li>
			<li>
				<External_Link href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</External_Link
				>, maybe others like <External_Link href="https://github.com/google/A2A"
					>Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol</External_Link

				I think it makes sense to prioritize a few high-utility integrations for manipulating media
				files, like <External_Link href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</External_Link>,
				<External_Link href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</External_Link>, and <External_Link
					href="https://imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</External_Link

			</li>
			<li>
				when I regain an appetite for social, <External_Link href="https://atproto.com/"
					>AT Protocol</External_Link
				> and <External_Link href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</External_Link> -- probably
				both but they're not immediate prioritie (I have an initial <External_Link
					href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/fuz_mastodon">Mastodon integration</External_Link
				> with readonly embedded posts)
			</li>
			<li>
				more, input welcome
				<ul>
					<li>
						the system is being designed for extensibility, so your use cases are helpful for
						shaping it
					</li>
					<li>
						devs can extend Zzz without artifcial restriction in their own projects, but Zzz should
						provide a complete system with useful defaults and optional high-quality first-party
						integrations
					</li>
					<li>
						some decisions like Postgres, TypeScript, and Svelte limit user choice -- you can always
						bring other databases and frontend frameworks, but don't expect full integration or
						reasonable performance; for example there is a serious mismatch with sqlite
					</li>
				</ul>

		<h2 class="mb_lg">Security</h2>
		<p>
			Zzz is a powerful and extensible system, and that means it carries significant security risks.
			Although it can be used to build simple and secure websites, the Zzz backend is capable like
			an IDE and can do bad things when bidden.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zzz puts the user in control, so if you insist on installing obvious_malware, Zzz will abide.
			This basic tension between power and safety leads me to think that UX design should be a
			primary mechanism of influence to protect users -- instead of restricting power from user
			control, we'll design for its safe usage, including clear visibility into your delegation
			situation. Maybe you'll have to click through an annoying UI and 2FA, obviously breaking the
			seal, to install the malware. Every person and situation may have a different threat model, so
			we want to make it easy to make good choices, where lazy is secure.
		</p>
		<aside>
			‚ö†Ô∏è I am not a security professional and Zzz has not been audited; it may be <strong
				class="color_c_5">dangerous</strong
			> to run and there is no auth yet
		</aside>
		<p>
			My current plan is to extract <External_Link href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/fuz"
				>a reusable framework</External_Link
			> out of Zzz that prioritizes security from the first commit. More on that soon. For now Zzz is
			insecure and should definitely not be run in production, and it should be used with caution in
			development.
		</p>
		<p>More thoughts about security:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Zzz's Node server can do things like:
				<ul>
					<li>
						read and write to the configured filesystem directory, defaults to <code>./.zzz</code>
						in the <code>PUBLIC_ZZZ_CACHE_DIR</code> (which defaults to <code>./</code>), and is
						securely scoped (does not follow symlinks) -- this opens a significant surface area for
						both you and attackers to use, and writing untrusted data to it could lead to arbitrary
						code execution if, for example, you're running a hot reloading dev server in that
						directory (Zzz does not do this by default)
					</li>
					<li>
						use your API keys for calls to Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, and write them to <code
							>./.env.{DEV ? 'development' : 'production'}</code
						>
					</li>
					<li>call Ollama's API if available -- low risk</li>
					<li>
						<strong class="color_c_5">there is no authentication yet</strong>, only an origin check,
						so do not use this in production
					</li>
					<li>
						soon, more integrations including terminal access assuming Bash, but nothing that
						powerful before auth
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				The frontend <External_Link
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Content_Security_Policy"
					>CSP</External_Link
				> is fairly locked down, including blocking all unknown network connections. For details, see
				the CSP config in <External_Link
					href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/blob/main/svelte.config.js"
					>svelte.config.js</External_Link
				> and the <External_Link href="https://www.fuz.dev/docs/csp">Fuz CSP docs</External_Link>.
				Configuration will be needed for many usecases, unlocking shenanigans good and bad, so we'll
				tread carefully.
			</li>
			<li>
				There are no mechanisms for end-users to load executable code or dangerous config. Of
				course, developers have full control to shoot their own feet, and Node is currently the only
				supported way to use Zzz. Deno is planned.
				<ul>
					<li>
						we'll develop a plugin API so people can make reusable integrations, and distribution
						will be through npm/jsr, decentralized like a typical open source web ecosystem project
						so the risks assumed by developers are unchanged and I gatekeep nothing -- I plan to
						publish a number of <code>@ryanatkn/zzz_*</code> packages, and if people think it's worth
						their time to make Zzz things, they can publish according to their taste and devs can vet
						their code
					</li>
					<li>
						any modules you install from npm/jsr, or any code you add to the src directory, carry
						the normal elevated risks associated with development and code execution -- I try to
						practice good <External_Link href="https://github.com/ryanatkn/fuz_template/issues/1"
							>dependency hygiene</External_Link
						>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				In 2025, LLMs have serious vulnerabilities to attacks like <External_Link
					href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_injection">prompt injection</External_Link
				>, where they are unable to reliably discern instructions intended by the prompter from
				adversarial instructions in the data. It's unclear if this is fixable but people are
				definitely building sensitive systems with probabilistic components, and I don't want to see
				Zzz, an AI UI, make dumb predictable errors with LLMs or be designed to encourage us to make
				them. MCP's utility is high, but it can be used in <External_Link
					href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/"
					title="Simon Willison‚Äôs Weblog: The lethal trifecta for AI agents: private data, untrusted content, and external communication"
					>insecure ways</External_Link
				> that I want to account for before integrating. Zzz will integrate LLMs into its own functionality
				slowly and carefully -- currently the only in-app LLM integration is using a local model to name
				new chats. There will be more, and we'll make sure you always have visibility into and control
				over this behavior. (for example see the
				<a href={resolve('/providers/ollama')}>Ollama controls</a>)
			</li>
			<li>
				Security and privacy should be the expected default, so for example Zzz won't make calls to
				external providers without explicit configuration. No other third party services are used.
			</li>
			<li>
				I prioritize security but it's not my expertise and I will make mistakes, help is always
				appreciated.
			</li>
