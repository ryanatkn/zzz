**[zzzbot.dev](https://www.zzzbot.dev/)**

Zzz, pronounced "zees" like the sound of electricity,
is a bot and web toolkit with a focus on user power and experimentation.
The idea is to make a digital tool that adapts to your needs on the fly
while remaining fully in your control and open source.
More at [zzzbot.dev/about](https://www.zzzbot.dev/about).

This is a pre-alpha and the ideas are still developing.
