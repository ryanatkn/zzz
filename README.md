**[zzz.software](https://www.zzz.software/)**

Zzz, pronounced "zees" like bees,
is a software project with a focus on user power and experimentation.
The idea is to make a fullstack software environment that adapts to your needs and intent
while remaining fully open, aligned, and in your control. It's a flexible toolkit
for consuming and creating content, developing web software,
and crafting experiences with uncompromising UX and DX.

This is an early stage project and the ideas are still developing -
see the issues and [discussions](https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/discussions)
or @ me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ryanatkn.com).

More at [zzz.software/about](https://www.zzz.software/about).

## Setup

This project is in its early stages, and installing it currently requires some technical skills.
Eventually there will be an installable desktop app for nontechnical users
(and for developers, an npm library for TypeScript and Svelte),
but it's not there yet -
for now you'll need Node 22.11+ (YMMV with Bun/Deno/etc)
and Git to clone the repo.

Zzz is deployed via SvelteKit's static adapter with diminished capabilities.

> Windows probably doesn't work but will be supported - help is appreciated.
> For now I recommend [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

First set up an `.env` file in your project root:

- see [src/lib/server/.env.example](/src/lib/server/.env.example)
  - add to `.env` or `.env.development` and `.env.production` -
    `SECRET_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SECRET_GOOGLE_API_KEY`

Then in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Browse to the location is says, probably `localhost:5173`.

## Credits üê¢<sub>üê¢</sub><sub><sub>üê¢</sub></sub>

Zzz builds on a great deal of software.

- see the deps in [package.json](package.json)
- I started using [Claude](https://claude.ai/) after making the initial prototype,
  and and I've continued to use it to varying but sufficient success
  to shape its outputs into my usual style
  - I'm meticulous with most things,
    but there's low quality slop in lower prioritity areas like some tests and peripheral utilities
  - search for `// @slop` to see them, I'll make a UI to document this data soon
  - for the important parts, I consider the code quality up to par with my norm
    (my normal quality being [Fuz](https://github.com/ryanatkn/fuz)/[Moss](https://github.com/ryanatkn/moss)/[Gro](https://github.com/ryanatkn/gro)/[Belt](https://github.com/ryanatkn/belt)),
    with the caveat that this initial proof of concept
    is intentionally slapdash in places for speed and to experiment,
    and LLMs make this mindset easy to indulge
