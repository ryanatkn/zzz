**[zzz.software](https://www.zzz.software/)**

Zzz, pronounced "zees" like bees,
is a fullstack web toolkit for power users and developers.
The idea is to make an integrated cross-platform environment that adapts to
your needs and intent while remaining fully open, aligned, and in your control.
It's both a customizable local-first web UI for power users,
and a flexible tool for crafting UX-maximizing websites
with a streamlined developer experience.

More at [zzz.software/about](https://www.zzz.software/about).

This is an early stage project and the ideas are still developing -
see the issues and [discussions](https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/discussions)
or find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ryanatkn.com).

## Setup

This project is in its early stages, and installing it
currently requires some basic technical skills.
Eventually there will be a desktop app but
for now you'll need Node 22.15+ (YMMV with Deno/Bun/etc)
and Git to clone the repo.

Running Zzz locally in development with Node is the supported way to use it right now.
It deploys via SvelteKit's static adapter with diminished capabilities
([zzz.software](https://www.zzz.software/)),
and it will have a production build with the Node adapter and Hono server soon.

> Developing on Windows
> requires something like [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

To run Zzz, we need an `.env.development` file in your project root.

In your terminal, copy over
[src/lib/server/.env.development.example](/src/lib/server/.env.development.example):

```bash
cp src/lib/server/.env.development.example .env.development --update=none
```

You can edit `.env.development` with your API keys,
or update them at runtime on the `/capabilities` page.

Then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Browse to the location is says, probably `localhost:5173`.

## Roadmap

- [#7 integrate database](https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/issues/7)
- [#8 undo/history system](https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/issues/8)
- publish to npm
- input welcome

## Credits üê¢<sub>üê¢</sub><sub><sub>üê¢</sub></sub>

Zzz builds on a great deal of software.

- see the deps in [package.json](package.json)
- I started using [Claude](https://claude.ai/) after making the initial prototype,
  and and I've continued to use it to varying but sufficient success
  to shape its outputs into my usual style
  - I'm meticulous with most things,
    but there's low quality slop in lower prioritity areas like tests and peripheral utilities
  - search for `// @slop` to see them, I'll make a UI to document this data soon
  - I care about the interfaces and general patterns of `// @slop` modules like all other code,
    but slop module internals may be low quality,
    and in general they should be less trusted for correctness and style
  - for the important parts, I consider the code quality up to par with my norm
    (my normal being [Fuz](https://github.com/ryanatkn/fuz)/[Moss](https://github.com/ryanatkn/moss)/[Gro](https://github.com/ryanatkn/gro)/[Belt](https://github.com/ryanatkn/belt)),
    with the caveat that this initial proof of concept
    is intentionally slapdash in places for speed and to experiment,
    and LLMs make this mindset easy to indulge,
    so there's a higher quantity of lower quality code in Zzz
    because I'm using LLMs in my workflows
    (and yearning for better tools so building Zzz with haste),
    but the important parts are carefully done, and I still prioritize quality over velocity
