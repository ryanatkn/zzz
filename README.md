**[zzz.software](https://www.zzz.software/)**

Zzz, pronounced "zees" like bees,
is a bot and web toolkit with a focus on user power and experimentation.
The idea is to make a digital tool that adapts to your needs on the fly
while remaining fully open, aligned, and in your control.
More at [zzz.software/about](https://www.zzz.software/about).

This is a pre-alpha and the ideas are still developing -
see the issues and [discussions](https://github.com/ryanatkn/zzz/discussions)
or @ me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ryanatkn.com).

## Motivation

1. control botz

## Setup

Zzz uses SvelteKit and Vite and currently requires Node.
(or at least, that's the only one I've tested)
The goal is to make it support many deployment targets and all the JS runtimes,
including a desktop installation and npm library,
but it's not there yet - for now you'll need Node 20.17+ and git to clone the repo.

> Windows probably doesn't work but will be supported - help is appreciated.
> For now I recommend [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

First set up an `.env` file in your project root:

- see [src/lib/server/.env.example](/src/lib/server/.env.example)
  - add to `.env` or `.env.development` and `.env.production` -
    `SECRET_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SECRET_GOOGLE_API_KEY`

Then in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Browse to the location is says, probably `localhost:5173`.
